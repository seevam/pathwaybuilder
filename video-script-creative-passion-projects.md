**NARRATOR:**
Everyone tells you to be creative.

But then they ask: "How will that make you money? What's the career path? Is that practical?"

**[Visual: Student picking up brush, pen, camera, instrument—beginning to create]**

**NARRATOR:**
Here's what they don't tell you:

**Your creative work doesn't need permission. It doesn't need to be practical. It just needs to EXIST.**

**[Visual: Student lost in flow, creating passionately]**

**NARRATOR:**
And the passion projects you create NOW?

**They become your portfolio. Your voice. Your proof.**

## ACT 3: HOW TO START YOUR CREATIVE PROJECT (1:40-2:20)

**[Visual: Student sitting down, ready to begin]**

**NARRATOR:**
Here's how to go from "I want to create something" to "I DID IT":

---

### Step 1: Choose Your Medium & Theme

**[Visual: Student choosing between different art forms]**

**NARRATOR:**
Pick ONE creative medium for this project. You can try others later.

Then pick a theme or question:
- What makes you angry?
- What do you love?
- What scares you?
- What story needs to be told?

**Great projects come from HONEST emotion, not perfection.**

---

### Step 2: Set a Constraint

**[Visual: Calendar, numbers, specific limits]**

**NARRATOR:**
Constraints make you more creative, not less.

Choose ONE:
- **Time:** Create every day for 30/60/100 days
- **Quantity:** Make 10 pieces, 20 poems, 5 songs
- **Format:** All black and white, under 3 minutes, haiku only
- **Theme:** Everything explores ONE idea

**Unlimited freedom is paralyzing. Constraints set you free.**

---

### Step 3: Create a Rough Draft of EVERYTHING First

**[Visual: Messy sketches, rough cuts, first drafts]**

**NARRATOR:**
Make the ugliest, messiest version of your whole project FIRST.

- All 10 drawings sketched
- All 5 songs recorded (even poorly)
- Entire script written (even badly)
- All photos taken (even out of focus)

**THEN go back and polish. Perfectionists never finish.**

---

### Step 4: Get Feedback From Other Creators

**[Visual: Students sharing work, giving critiques]**

**NARRATOR:**
Show your work to people who CREATE, not just consume.

- Art teachers
- Other student artists
- Online creative communities
- Local artists (email them—many will respond!)

**Don't ask "Do you like it?" Ask "What could be stronger?"**

---

### Step 5: Document Your Process

**[Visual: Progress photos, time-lapses, behind-the-scenes]**

**NARRATOR:**
Take photos/videos of your work-in-progress.

Post:
- Sketches → Final piece
- First draft → Polished version
- Failed attempts (people LOVE seeing the mess!)

**Process videos get MORE engagement than finished work.**

**Platform:** TikTok, Instagram Stories, YouTube Shorts

---

### Step 6: FINISH and SHARE

**[Visual: Finished project being posted, exhibited, performed]**

**NARRATOR:**
90% of people start. 10% finish.

**Be in the 10%.**

When it's done:
- Post it online with context (what you made, why you made it)
- Submit to competitions, festivals, publications
- Display it physically (school, library, coffee shops)
- Add it to your portfolio

**[Visual: Portfolio growing with each project]**

**Your first project won't be your best. That's fine. Make the next one.**

---

## ACT 4: THE CREATIVE PAYOFF (2:20-2:50)

**[Visual: Montage of student creators achieving success]**

**NARRATOR:**
Here's what happens when you finish creative projects:

**College Applications:**
- Art schools want portfolios, not just grades
- Liberal arts schools love students with DEMONSTRATED creativity
- You have actual work to discuss in essays and interviews

**Opportunities:**
- Scholarships for artists, writers, filmmakers
- Commissions (people will PAY you to create)
- Collaborations with other creators
- Features in publications, galleries, festivals

**Personal Growth:**
- You PROVE to yourself you can finish hard things
- You develop your unique artistic voice
- You learn to handle criticism and failure
- You build confidence

**[Visual: Student looking at their finished project, genuinely proud]**

**NARRATOR:**
But the real reason to create?

That feeling when you make something that didn't exist before.

**[Visual: Audience reacting to creative work—tears, laughter, awe]**

**NARRATOR:**
When someone sees your art and FEELS something.

When someone reads your words and says "You put into words what I couldn't."

When someone hears your music and it changes their day.

**THAT is why you create.**

---

## CLOSING (2:50-3:00)

**[Visual: Empty canvas → Student creating → Finished masterpiece]**

**NARRATOR:**
Your creative voice matters.

Your stories deserve to be told.

Your art deserves to exist.

**[Visual: Text overlay appears]**

**"Done is better than perfect. Start is better than someday."**

**[Visual: Call-to-action screen]**

**NARRATOR:**
Stop waiting for inspiration. Stop waiting for permission.

**Your masterpiece starts with the first imperfect attempt.**

## OVERCOMING CREATIVE BLOCKS

**[Mini-section for bonus content]**

**"I don't feel inspired."**
→ Inspiration comes AFTER you start, not before. Set a timer for 15 minutes and create ANYTHING.

**"Everything I make is terrible."**
→ Your taste is better than your current skill. That gap closes with practice. Make 100 terrible things. #87 will be good.

**"Someone else already did this."**
→ They didn't do it with YOUR perspective, YOUR voice, YOUR experience. Make it anyway.

**"I'm scared to share my work."**
→ Start small. Share with one trusted friend. Then five. Then post online. Fear shrinks with exposure.

**"I started but can't finish."**
→ Make the scope smaller. Can't finish a novel? Finish one chapter. Can't finish an album? Finish one song.

**"I don't have time."**
→ 15 minutes a day = 91 hours a year. You have time. You're choosing other things. That's fine—but be honest about it.

## THE CREATIVE MANIFESTO

**[Can be shown as inspirational text overlay]**

**You don't need fancy tools. You need to START.**

**You don't need talent. You need CONSISTENCY.**

**You don't need permission. You need COURAGE.**

**Your first draft will be bad. MAKE IT ANYWAY.**

**Your work will get criticized. SHARE IT ANYWAY.**

**You will fail at some projects. START THE NEXT ONE ANYWAY.**

**Create because you HAVE to, not because you SHOULD.**

**Create what only YOU can create.**

**Create even when no one's watching.**

**Create especially when no one's watching.**

**The world needs your voice.**

**So SPEAK. PAINT. WRITE. SING. FILM. DESIGN.**

**CREATE.**

---

**END SCRIPT**

**Final Message to Students:**

"Every artist you admire was once where you are now—staring at a blank page, a blank canvas, a blank screen, wondering if they could actually do it. They started anyway. They created badly, then okay, then good, then great. Your creative journey doesn't begin when you're 'ready.' It begins when you're brave enough to start. So start. Today. Now. Create something messy and imperfect and YOURS. The world is waiting for what only you can make."
