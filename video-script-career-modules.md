## ACT 1: THE PROBLEM (0:15-0:35)

**[Visual: Montage of students stressed, scrolling through endless career websites]**

**NARRATOR:**
Most students choose careers based on what sounds cool, what pays well, or what their parents suggest. But here's the thing—

**None of that matters if it doesn't align with WHO YOU ARE.**

Your values. Your strengths. Your passions. Your work style.

Traditional career exploration? It's just random Googling and hoping something clicks.
