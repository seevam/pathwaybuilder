**Duration:** ~2-3 minutes
**Tone:** Energetic, inspiring, empowering
**Target Audience:** High school students (ages 14-18)

---

## OPENING (0:00-0:15)

**[Visual: Montage of teens scrolling phones, gaming, watching YouTube]**

**NARRATOR:**
You spend hours on apps, games, and websites every single day.

But have you ever wondered—

**[Visual: Zoom into student's curious face]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Could I BUILD something like this?"

**[Visual: Screen text appears: "YES. YOU CAN."]**

**NARRATOR:**
Spoiler alert: You absolutely can. And here's why you should start TODAY.

## ACT 1: WHY PASSION PROJECTS MATTER (0:15-0:45)

**[Visual: Student working late on laptop, excited about their project]**

**NARRATOR:**
A technical passion project isn't homework. It's not for a grade. It's not because someone told you to.

It's something YOU create because you actually CARE about it.

**[Visual: Split screen showing different projects - app, website, robot, game]**

**NARRATOR:**
Maybe it's an app that solves a problem in your school.
Maybe it's a website for your favorite hobby.
Maybe it's a game, a robot, or something nobody's even thought of yet.

**[Visual: Student presenting project, feeling proud]**

**NARRATOR:**
Here's the truth colleges and employers won't tell you:

**Your passion projects matter more than your GPA.**

They show you can learn independently.
They prove you can finish what you start.
They demonstrate REAL skills—not just test scores.

## ACT 2: PROJECT IDEAS FOR EVERY INTEREST (0:45-1:30)

**[Visual: Animated icons representing different project categories]**

**NARRATOR:**
"But I don't know what to build!"

Here are real projects high school students just like you have created:

---

### For Gamers

**[Visual: Game development interface]**

**NARRATOR:**
Build your own game using Unity, Godot, or even Roblox Studio.
Start simple—a 2D platformer, a quiz game, a visual novel.

**Real Example:** A 16-year-old built a mobile game about climate change that got 50,000 downloads.

---

### For Social Media Addicts

**[Visual: Web development, app mockups]**

**NARRATOR:**
Create a website or app for something you love.

- A platform for students to trade class notes
- A local event finder for teens
- A mental health check-in app for your school

**Real Example:** Two sisters built a tutoring platform connecting students in their district—now used by 500+ students.

---

### For Problem Solvers

**[Visual: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, robotics]**

**NARRATOR:**
Build hardware that solves real problems.

- An automatic plant watering system
- A smart doorbell for your home
- A bike safety light that detects traffic

**Real Example:** A student built a low-cost air quality monitor for their community after wildfires.

---

### For Artists & Creators

**[Visual: Digital art tools, music software, 3D modeling]**

**NARRATOR:**
Combine art and code.

- Generate art with code (generative art)
- Build a digital portfolio website
- Create music with code using Sonic Pi
- Design 3D models for games or 3D printing

**Real Example:** A teen created an AI tool that turns sketches into pixel art—went viral on TikTok.

---

### For Data Nerds

**[Visual: Charts, graphs, data visualizations]**

**NARRATOR:**
Analyze data and tell stories.

- Track your school's sports statistics
- Visualize climate data from your city
- Build a personal finance tracker
- Create a dashboard for a cause you care about

**Real Example:** A student analyzed their school's lunch data and convinced administration to add healthier options.

---

### For the "I Have No Idea" Crowd

**[Visual: Simple project examples]**

**NARRATOR:**
Start with something STUPIDLY simple:

- A personal website about your favorite band
- A calculator for your favorite game
- A Discord bot for your friend group
- A Chrome extension that blocks spoilers

**The point isn't to build the next Facebook. It's to START.**

---

## ACT 3: HOW TO ACTUALLY START (1:30-2:15)

**[Visual: Student at computer, split-screen showing steps]**

**NARRATOR:**
Here's your action plan:

### Step 1: Pick ONE Idea
**[Visual: Notebook with project ideas]**

Don't overthink it. Choose something that excites you RIGHT NOW. You can always build more later.

---

### Step 2: Find FREE Resources
**[Visual: Logos of YouTube, freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, Khan Academy]**

You don't need expensive courses. Everything is free:

- **YouTube tutorials** for literally any tech skill
- **freeCodeCamp** for web development
- **CS50** (Harvard's free course) for computer science basics
- **Scratch** or **Python** for beginners
- **GitHub** to store and share your code

---

### Step 3: Build Messy First, Perfect Later
**[Visual: Rough prototype → polished version]**

Your first version will suck. THAT'S NORMAL.

Build the ugliest, buggiest version first. Then improve it. Version 1 doesn't need to be perfect—it just needs to EXIST.

---

### Step 4: Share Your Work
**[Visual: GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio website]**

Post your project on:
- **GitHub** (employers actually check this)
- **LinkedIn** (yes, even in high school)
- **Your own portfolio website**
- **Twitter/X or TikTok** (the tech community is huge there)

**[Visual: Student getting comments and encouragement]**

You'll get feedback, make connections, and build a reputation—all before college applications.

---

### Step 5: Don't Stop at One
**[Visual: Portfolio showing multiple projects]**

One project is cool. Three projects show dedication. Five projects? You're unstoppable.

Each project teaches you something new. Each one goes on your resume.

---

## ACT 4: THE REAL PAYOFF (2:15-2:45)

**[Visual: Student getting college acceptance letters, internship offers]**

**NARRATOR:**
Here's what happens when you build passion projects:

**College Applications:** You have something UNIQUE to write about. Everyone has good grades. Not everyone built a working app.

**Job & Internship Opportunities:** Companies hire based on what you can DO, not what's on your transcript.

**Confidence:** You prove to yourself that you can learn hard things and create something from nothing.

**[Visual: Montage of diverse students working on different projects, smiling]**

**NARRATOR:**
But honestly? The best part isn't the external rewards.

It's the moment when you type that last line of code, test your project, and it WORKS.

**[Visual: Student's face lighting up as their project runs successfully]**

**NARRATOR:**
That moment when you realize:

"Holy crap. I BUILT this."

**THAT is why you start.**

---

## CLOSING (2:45-3:00)

**[Visual: Split screen of empty code editor → finished project]**

**NARRATOR:**
You have the time. You have the tools. You have the internet.

The only question is: What are you going to build?

**[Visual: Text overlay appears]**

**"Your passion project starts with one line of code."**

**[Visual: Call-to-action screen]**

**NARRATOR:**
Stop watching. Start building.

Your future self will thank you.
