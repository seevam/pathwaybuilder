Ready to start? Here's your roadmap:

### Step 1: Choose ONE Business Idea

**[Visual: Student circling one idea in notebook]**

Don't try to do everything. Pick ONE thing you're excited about and can start THIS WEEK.

---

### Step 2: Validate Before You Build

**[Visual: Student asking friends, posting polls]**

Before spending money, ask:
- Would your friends/family pay for this?
- Post on social media—do people respond?
- Create a simple Google Form survey

**If nobody cares in the idea phase, they won't care when you launch.**

---

### Step 3: Start Small & Scrappy

**[Visual: Simple first version of product/service]**

You don't need:
- A fancy website (start with Instagram + Venmo)
- A business name or logo (can add later)
- A business plan (just start selling!)

**Done is better than perfect. Launch fast, improve later.**

---

### Step 4: Get Your First 3 Customers

**[Visual: Student reaching out, making sales]**

Your first customers will be:
- Friends and family (they'll support you!)
- Classmates who need what you offer
- Local community (neighbors, local Facebook groups)

**After 3 sales, you have proof it works. Now scale.**

---

### Step 5: Reinvest & Grow

**[Visual: Money going back into business, business growing]**

Take your profits and:
- Buy better equipment/materials
- Run small ads on Instagram/Facebook
- Improve your product based on feedback
- Hire friends to help (scale your time!)

**[Visual: Business growing from bedroom → store → multiple locations]**

---

### Step 6: Track Everything

**[Visual: Spreadsheet with income/expenses]**

Use a simple spreadsheet to track:
- Every dollar you make
- Every dollar you spend
- What's working and what's not

**This isn't boring—this is how you know if you're winning.**

## ACT 4: THE REAL LESSONS (2:30-2:50)

**[Visual: Student reflecting on their journey]**

**You WILL fail at some things.** That's the point. Every failure teaches you something school never will.

You'll learn:
- How to handle rejection (when people say no)
- How to manage money (better than any finance class)
- How to solve problems (when things go wrong)

- How to be resilient (when things get hard)

You're an ENTREPRENEUR who built something from nothing.
